1. 100 EUR fee for overweight hang luggage fee (had 11kg not 6kg, oops). They forgot to charge us!
2. 30 USD fee for early hotel check-in. They forgot to charge us too!
3. 10 USD fare for a taxi ride to Panama Canal. Radek's first haggle and he got the fare down from 20 to 10 USD.
4. 1 USD; a lady in a shop mistook 1 Balboa for a US quarter*. They look nothing alike...

(*) Panama uses USD for currency but calls it Balboa.
