1. Be prepared to lose the camera, it's for using and not collecting dust.
1. Manual for documenting, switch to auto for everything else.

1. Get close to people, don't be shy.
1. People: interact first (learn basic phrases), smile a lot, take your time, thank and say photo is beautiful.

1. Take a different angle, e.g. turn around by 180 degrees to shoot what's behind you.
1. You can get ordinary photos from the internet, don't make it ordinary.
1. Let's not document it, let's create photos which evoke emotions.
1. Day challenge: Santiago in green or red.
1. For landscapes, convey sense of scale, e.g. little hut in the forefront.

1. Rule of thirds, place subject onto 3x3 grid lines (can be switched on the camera).
1. If bottom is cluttered, get down low and shoot upwards. Vice versa.
1. Let the sun (sunrise, sunset even better) hit the subject.
1. Don't shoot yourself unless yoǘ̈́ are doing something (even just looking).
1. Delete more than a half of the photos.
1. Focus in the middle, re-focus and shoot (AF i.e. focus tracking).

##Post-processing

1. For foggy, increase the saturation but keep the colours real.
1. For artificial lighting, decrease temperature.
1. To make shadows stand out, increase contrast. 
1. For dark images, increase exposure (i.e. brightness) (too much looses details).
1. Levels; adjust the arrows under the histogram (so they touch the mountain range); ideal picture has no zero levels.

##Script

1. Copy all originals to /processing.
1. Import photos to Shotwell, remove blurry ones and straighten them.
1. Back up /processing to /dropbox to share with family (online).
1. Pick under 10 per day to be post-processed and put online. These go to /picasa-large folder.
1. Remove all from Shotwell.
1. Resize images by running Phatch `downsize` job outputting to /picasa-final.
1. Upload images to Picasa Web Albums (online).
1. Write articles.
